# Day IV Notes

## Resume Note with Katie Spencer

### Top Three Resume Blockers:

1. ***Not optimizing the top fold***
    - "Top Fold": imagine folding resume in half, and just looking at the top portion. This is what would be considered the "top fold." Average time a person looks at a resume is 7 seconds, so the real estate at top half of resume is critical to indicate you're a good fit for a role.
2. ***Power statements for projects***
    - Highlight what you personally built and how you built it
    - Use active voice and begin with strong action verbs
    - Eliminate phrases such as "helped with" or "worked on"
    - Quantify deadlines, # of collaborators and any relevant details about the process
    - Basic power phrase formula: `[power word] [app feature] "using" [tech skill/tool]`
        - Ex. Deployed API endpoints using Postgres ETL pipeline
3. ***Power statements for previous experience***
    - Highlight "value adds": time saved, revenue generated, positive feedback, etc (quantify it!)
