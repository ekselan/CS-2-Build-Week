# **Day I Notes**


## ***Describing Your Code in an Interview***

Pretend you already have the job and the interviewer is a coworker who came to you
for help on a difficult problem.
* If you already had the job, there's no stress
* Reframes the situation from an interview to just problem-solving
* Puts you in a cooperative mindset
* It forces you to *teach* the problem and solution

---

## ***UPER is the key to it all***

### **Understand**
* Ask questions about the problem
* Dialog
* Rephrase the problem back to the interviewer in your own words
* Teaching the "what" of the problem to the interviewer

### **Plan**
* Come up with multiple plans, if possible
* Don't ignore the naive plan
* Teach the plan to the interviewer
* Think in big concepts, not code

### **Execute**
* If you're describing existing code:
  * Interviewer will look for where the concepts match the blocks of code
  * Point out interesting things in it
  * Make sure it's well commented and looks good
* If you're writing new code:
  * Interviewer will look for where the concepts match the blocks of code
  * Actually code it up at this point

### **Reflect**
* What could we have done better?
* Future directions and features
* If you made any mistakes, point them out with solutions.

## **Interview Prep notes with Lindsay Gilson**
- ### Feedback from hiring managers
    - **Mistakes Noticed**
        1. Candidate not having researched company, hiring manager, etc prior to interview
        2. Not being detail oriented (typos, misspelled words, tardniess, etc)
        3. Lack of engagement (no questions, seeming disinterested)
        4. Not being able to explain "why" (why they want to work there, why they should be hired, why they're a culture fit, etc.)

# **Day IV Notes**

## **Resume Notes with Katie Spencer**

### Top Three Resume Blockers:

1. ***Not optimizing the top fold***
    - "Top Fold": imagine folding resume in half, and just looking at the top portion. This is what would be considered the "top fold." Average time a person looks at a resume is 7 seconds, so the real estate at top half of resume is critical to indicate you're a good fit for a role.
2. ***Power statements for projects***
    - Highlight what you personally built and how you built it
    - Use active voice and begin with strong action verbs
    - Eliminate phrases such as "helped with" or "worked on"
    - Quantify deadlines, # of collaborators and any relevant details about the process
    - Basic power phrase formula: `[power word] [app feature] "using" [tech skill/tool]`
        - Ex. Deployed API endpoints using Postgres ETL pipeline
3. ***Power statements for previous experience***
    - Highlight "value adds": time saved, revenue generated, positive feedback, etc (quantify it!)
